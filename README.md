## Usage 🖱️
```sh
aghpb-cli {query}
```
Check out help for more: ``aghpb-cli --help``

## Installation 🛠️
I don't plan on releasing to any package managers any time soon so for now you must install from source (like a real man).

Prerequisites: **[``git``](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [``rust-lang``](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), ``make`` (recommended)**

### Linux 🐧
```sh
git clone https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/aghpb-cli
cd aghpb-cli
```
Now if you have 'make' you may just run these commands and you're done:
```sh
make # build
sudo make install # install to bin
```
If you don't have 'make' for some reason go and copy the code from the [makefile](https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/aghpb-cli/blob/master/Makefile) yourself but try the make command at least you might already have it and I highly recommend you install it.

### Windows 🪟
*too lazy to add the instructions, someone do it for me* 😴
